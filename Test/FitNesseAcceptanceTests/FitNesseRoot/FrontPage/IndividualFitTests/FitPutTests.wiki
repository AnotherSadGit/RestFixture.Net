!3 PUT

!* Note
This test shows how to pass bespoke headers in the request. In this specific case, the stub 
echoes back the 'Echo-Header', so that the following PUT and GET can match it the response.
*!

A PUT request should update the specified resource and return a 200 (OK) status code: 

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 | 
| setBody   | <resource><name>name being updated</name><data>data being updated</data></resource> |
| setHeader | Echo-Header : echoed                                |
| GET       | /resources/0 | 200 | Echo-Header : echoed |         |
| PUT       | /resources/0 | 200 | Echo-Header : echoed | no-body |
| GET       | /resources/0 | 200 | Echo-Header : echoed | !-/resource/name[text()='name being updated']
/resource/data[text()='data being updated']-! |
