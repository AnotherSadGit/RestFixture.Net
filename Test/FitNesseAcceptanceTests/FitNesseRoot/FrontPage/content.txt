!4 Note for Developers and Administrators: Source Control Line Endings
If these tests are to be saved in source control, particularly in a git repository, then the 
repository needs to be configured to handle line endings as commit as-is, check out as-is.  This 
is in contrast to the git for Windows default which is commit UNIX-style, with LF line endings, 
and check-out Windows-style, with CRLF line endings.

This is because the new FitNesse *.wiki file format, which replaces the old content.txt and 
properties.xml files, requires page properties to have LF line endings.  Page properties, which 
can indicate whether the page is a test page or a suite page, will be ignored if they have CRLF 
line endings.  In that case FitNesse will not recognise test and suite pages and users will be 
unable to run tests.
