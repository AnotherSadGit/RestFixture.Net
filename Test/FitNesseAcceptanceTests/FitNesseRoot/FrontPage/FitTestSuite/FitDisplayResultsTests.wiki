!3 Display or Hide Results via Config Table

!* Difference in Behaviour from Original Java !-RestFixture-!:

!-RestFixture.Net-! can display the actual results of a test alongside the expected results for 
both FIT and SLiM tests.  The original Java !-RestFixture-! doesn't display actual results 
alongside expected results for FIT tests, only for SLiM tests.
*!

Actual results should be displayed by default, as long as they are not identical to the expected 
results:

So the actual results are ''not'' displayed for the Status Code column, as the actual results are 
identical to the expected results.  However, the actual results ''are'' displayed for the 
Expected Headers and Expected Body columns as they are not identical to the expected results.

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

Actual results should ''not'' be displayed alongside expected results if the config table setting is 
false:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | false |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

If an expected result column is left blank the actual results should be displayed, even if the 
config table setting is false:

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 |  |  |

Actual results ''should'' be displayed alongside expected results if the config table setting is 
true:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | true |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

The toggling of actual results should work for JSON bodies as well as XML:

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/1.json | 200 | Content-Type : application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1 | !-jsonbody.resource.name=='a funky name'
jsonbody.resource.data=='an important message'-! |

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | false |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/1.json | 200 | Content-Type : application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1 | !-jsonbody.resource.name=='a funky name'
jsonbody.resource.data=='an important message'-! |
