!3 Display or Hide Results via Config Table

!* Difference in Behaviour from Original Java !-RestFixture-!:

!-RestFixture.Net-! can display the actual results of a test alongside the expected results for 
both FIT and SLiM tests.  The original Java !-RestFixture-! doesn't display actual results 
alongside expected results for FIT tests, only for SLiM tests.
*!

Actual results should be displayed by default, as long as they are not identical to the expected 
results:

So the actual results are ''not'' displayed for the Status Code column, as the actual results are 
identical to the expected results.  However, the actual results ''are'' displayed for the 
Expected Headers and Expected Body columns as they are not identical to the expected results.

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

Actual results should ''not'' be displayed alongside expected results if the config table setting is 
false:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | false |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

If an expected result column is left blank the actual results should be displayed, even if the 
config table setting is false:

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 |  |  |

Actual results ''should'' be displayed alongside expected results if the config table setting is 
true:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | true |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/0 | 200 | Content-Length : [\d]+ | !-/resource/name[text()='a funky name'] 
/resource/data[text()='an important message'] -! |

The toggling of actual results should work for JSON bodies as well as XML:

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/1.json | 200 | Content-Type : application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1 | !-jsonbody.resource.name=='a funky name'
jsonbody.resource.data=='an important message'-! |

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | false |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/1.json | 200 | Content-Type : application/json;charset=ISO-8859-1 | !-jsonbody.resource.name=='a funky name'
jsonbody.resource.data=='an important message'-! |

!3 Collapseable Content

When the actual body is displayed sometimes it will be very large.  In the interest of readability, 
large content in cells can be hidden by default and a button displayed to toggle the visibility of 
the content.  Whether the toggle button is displayed is determined by the value of the config setting 

'''restfixture.display.toggle.for.cells.larger.than'''

This defines the minimum number of characters in the cell for which the toggle button is displayed.

A negative value disables this feature: Content will always be displayed, no matter how long it is, 
and the toggle button will never be displayed.  The default value is -1, meaning this feature is 
disabled by default.

!* Difference in Behaviour from Original Java !-RestFixture-!:

In !-RestFixture.Net-! Collapsible Content can be enabled for both FIT and SLiM tests.  In the 
original Java !-RestFixture-! this feature is only available for SLiM tests, not for FIT.
*!

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | true |

By default, lengthy content should always be visible:

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/100 | 200 |  | /resource/type[text()='large content'] |

If the collapsible content config setting is positive, content with more than that number of characters 
should be hidden and a button displayed to expand and collapse the content:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.toggle.for.cells.larger.than | 100 |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/100 | 200 |  | /resource/type[text()='large content'] |

If the actual content is not displayed, the toggle button should not be visible, even for content that 
is longer than the configured collapsible content threshold:

!| Rest Fixture Config |
| restfixture.display.actual.on.right | false |

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 |
| GET | /resources/100 | 200 |  | /resource/type[text()='large content'] |
