!3 DELETE

!* Note
For a GET after a DELETE, ie when requesting a non-existent resource, it may be best to avoid any 
expectations in either the header cell or the body cell of the GET request.  See example below.
*!

A DELETE request should remove the specified resource and return a 204 (No Content) status code: 

| Fit Rest Fixture | http://localhost:7654 | 
| GET    | /resources/0 | 200 |  |         |
| DELETE | /resources/0 | 204 |  | no-body |
| GET    | /resources/0 | 404 |  |         |
