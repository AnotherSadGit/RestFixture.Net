# General Notes
# -------------
# To reference a property from this file in a FitNesse test page use the FitNesse markup
# variable syntax:
#   ${property name}
# eg ${Theme}

# Any backslashes, "\", for example in directory paths, will need to be escaped by doubling them: "\\"

# Environment variables can be included in properties using the FitNesse markup variable syntax,
# eg
#    FitSharpDirectory=${FITNESSE_HOME}\\FitSharp
# where FITNESSE_HOME is an environment variable.

# Properties from this file become markup variables, not symbols, so they can only be used in test
#   pages, not in fixture class code.
# (A symbol is the equivalent of a .NET variable, so is available to the .NET fixture class.  A
#   markup variable is the equivalent of a pre-processor macro.  As FitNesse is parsing the wiki
#   pages it will find all instances of a ${property name} placeholder in all pages and replace
#   them with the equivalent value read from this file.  The .NET test fixture class will only see
#   the rendered page, after the placeholders have been replaced, so will never see the markup
#   variable placeholders)

# Built-in Properties

# The list of available built-in properties can be found here:

# Class paths
# -----------
# Escape backslashes in paths by doubling them.
# Do NOT end the path with a final backslash.
# Absolute or relative paths are allowed.
# Property names are free text so new directories can be added as required.
