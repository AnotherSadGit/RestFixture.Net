URLs in Java RestFixture
========================
Simon ELms, 22 Jul 2017

The original Java version of RestFixture uses the Apache HttpClient library.  The RestClientImpl 
object used to send HTTP requests and receive the responses wraps an HttpClient object.

----------------------------
PartsFactory.buildRestClient
----------------------------
PartsFactory.buildRestClient builds the RestClientImpl object.  For a start it creates an 
HttpClient object via HttpClientBuilder.createHttpClient.

	----------------------------------
	HttpClientBuilder.createHttpClient
	----------------------------------
	Creates an HttpClient object and configures it based on a config object.

	The following config values are used:

	* "http.client.connection.timeout": Sets the HttpClient socket timeout;
	* "http.proxy.host" and "http.proxy.port": Set the address and port of the proxy server;
	* "http.basicauth.username" and "http.basicauth.password": Set username and password for HTTP 
		Basic authentication.

	----------------------------------

PartsFactory.buildRestClient passes the configured HttpClient into the constructor of 
RestClientImpl.  It uses an anonymous class to override the following methods of the RestClientImpl 
object it constructs and returns:

* createUri: 
	* If config "http.client.use.new.http.uri.factory" is true, returns an 
		org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpURL(uriString) object.  This is a wrapper around 
		org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI and sets the escaped parameter to false.  So the URL is 
		seen as not escaped;
	* If config "http.client.use.new.http.uri.factory" is false, returns 
		RestClientImpl.createUri(uriString, escaped), which returns new URI(uriString, escaped).
		* escaped parameter is set in RestFixture.configFixture() to config value 
			"restfixture.resource.uris.are.escaped".  configFixture() is called in initialize(), 
			which is called for both Fit and Slim.  
		* XML docs say that if "restfixture.resource.uris.are.escaped" is true, RestFixture will 
			assume that the resource uris are already escaped. If false, resource uri will be 
			escaped. Defaults to false.
	NOTE: .NET DOESN'T NEED TO BE TOLD EXPLICITLY TO ESCAPE THE URL.  THE Uri CONSTRUCTOR WILL 
			ESCAPE THE RELATIVE URL STRING AUTOMATICALLY, IF REQUIRED.

* getMethodClassnameFromMethodName: Gets the HttpClient method needed to send the request (eg GET, 
	POST, etc).  .NET doesn't need a separate method to send different types of requests so we can 
	ignore this method.

^setUri
  ^configureHttpMethod
    ^execute
